    <!-- First way to include/write JS...don't do this 
      <script>
      alert("Something...");
    </script> -->
    <!-- Google analytics ask to put js in the head...don't worry it will not cause any problem, since it doesn't deal with the DOM -->

    <!-- Second way: 
    <script>
      alert("Something...")

    <h1>HTML</h1>

    <!-- Third here: - the best...it will probably deal with the DOM, so the DOM should be before the JS
    <script>
      alert('Something...')
    <script>-->
    <!-- The best practice -->
    <script src="javascript.js"></script>
  </body>
